# [Red Ventures - Pool Pros]

It is a semi- functional website for the users to find and get best in place Pool Services and Installation. 

## About

- It starts with a static display of few dealer records(just for the purpose of filling the body with some content initially).

- When the used clicks on "Find a Pro" button , given json data is parsed and asynchronously displayed on the home page. 
  -- since the data available for just one zipcode, temporarily we are not showing the results based on user location
  
  -- However, I have also included an option to retrieve the current zip code of the user on click of the button.(For future use)
  
- Modal boxes are designed for users to key in their contact information along with their queries. 

- basic validation is done. 

## Future Extentions

- Filter feature can be implemented
- Can display dealers available closer to the user location. 
- chat system can be integrated for immediate assistance.
